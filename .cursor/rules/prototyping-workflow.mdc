# Prototyping Workflow

## Concept Request Flow

When the user describes a UI concept:

1. **Echo back a structured brief** before generating anything:
   - **Subject**: What is being designed (e.g., dashboard, settings panel, onboarding flow)
   - **Layout**: Spatial arrangement (e.g., sidebar + main content, full-width cards, tabbed)
   - **Key Elements**: List the specific UI components mentioned (buttons, charts, forms, etc.)
   - **Style Notes**: Any aesthetic direction (minimal, dense, playful, corporate, etc.)
   - **Constraints**: Device target, accessibility needs, brand alignment

2. **Wait for user confirmation** ("go" / "looks good") or revision before proceeding.

3. **Generate two options in parallel** using two Task subagents:
   - Option A and Option B should take meaningfully different approaches (layout variation, visual emphasis, interaction model, etc.)
   - Each subagent calls `GenerateImage` with a detailed prompt that includes "wireframe sketch style" or "hand-drawn UI mockup" directive
   - Save images to `concepts/{concept-name}/option-a.png` and `option-b.png`

4. **Create or update `concepts/{concept-name}/brief.md`** with:
   - The confirmed description
   - Which options were generated
   - User feedback and iteration notes

## Concept Naming

- Use lowercase, hyphen-separated names (e.g., `retirement-dashboard`, `plan-wizard`, `report-card`)
- Keep names short and descriptive

## Prototype Promotion

When the user says a concept is ready for interactive prototyping:

1. Create a new page/route under `prototypes/src/{concept-name}/`
2. Use React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
3. Build static UI that simulates the selected mockup -- no real backend calls
4. Use placeholder data and mock interactions (state changes, transitions, modals)

## File Organization

```
concepts/{concept-name}/
  option-a.png          # First generated mockup
  option-b.png          # Second generated mockup
  brief.md              # Description, feedback, iteration log

prototypes/src/{concept-name}/
  index.tsx             # Main page component
  components/           # Concept-specific components
```

## Agent Cleanup

- Do not leave behind test data or temporary files
- If scratch files are created during iteration, remove them before finishing
