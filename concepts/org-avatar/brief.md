# NorthHarbor Dev Org Avatar

**Date:** 2026-02-23

## Description

Avatar for the `northharbor-dev` GitHub organization. Combines the NorthHarbor lighthouse motif with a tech/development identity.

## Selected Concept: Lighthouse + NH Foundation with Gradient

- Flat minimalist lighthouse in teal/seafoam with dark slate blue outlines
- Code angle brackets `< >` in the light beams (tech/dev signal)
- "NH" lettering integrated at the lighthouse base
- Trapezoid foundation with slightly angled sides, multi-toned blue-gray gradient panels matching the lighthouse body treatment
- Light seafoam/mint background
- Compact, designed for small avatar rendering

## Ideogram Prompt (for polished version)

> Flat minimalist logo icon, square format. A tall lighthouse with code angle brackets < > in its light beams emanating from the lantern room. The lighthouse body is teal and seafoam green with dark slate blue outlines and multi-toned geometric panels. The letters NH appear at the base of the lighthouse in a bold blocky font. Below that, a trapezoid foundation block with slightly angled sides and the same multi-toned blue-gray panel treatment as the lighthouse body. Light seafoam mint background. Clean outlines, muted flat fills, no photorealism. Suitable for a small GitHub organization avatar.

## Iteration History

1. Option A (lighthouse + brackets) vs Option B (lighthouse + circuit board) -- chose A for simplicity
2. Variants A1-A3 exploring bracket placement, terminal cursor, minimal rays -- original A still preferred
3. Added NH text: flanking (too heavy), beside (disconnected)
4. NH below base, NH in foundation block, NH in circle badge -- foundation concept selected
5. Foundation refined: smaller plinth (V2b), then taller lighthouse (V1 final) -- selected
6. Added trapezoid foundation with angled sides beneath NH band
7. Foundation gradient: multi-toned blue-gray panels matching lighthouse body -- final selection
